# ðŸ’³ Stripe Payment Example â€” Built with Next.js

This is a basic example demonstrating how to integrate Stripe payments into a **Next.js** application. This project showcases Next.js frontend and backend integration, secure payment processing using Stripe, and a simple UI to initiate payments.

To get started, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and set up environment variables with your Stripe keys. After setting up, run the development server and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

To test the payment flow, use the following Stripe test card:

- **Card Number:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiration Date:**  `12/34`
- **CVC:** `567`
- **ZIP Code:** `12345`

This card will simulate a successful payment in test mode.

The tech stack includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
